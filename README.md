# Blog with nodejs

Rebuilt my <a href='https://github.com/ndujesco/blog'>blog website</a> with nodejs.


Since I already had users in the former, I had to use same authentication algorithm so I created an <a href='https://github.com/ndujesco/compareHash'>API</a> with flask.
Performed typical CRUD operations and worked on database relationships.
